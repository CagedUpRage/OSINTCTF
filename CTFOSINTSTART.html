    <p>Welcome to my OSINT CTF</p>
    <p>You will need to find out three things to be able to put in the correct CTF code:</p>
    <p>The code is as follows, my home address where I live with my parents, the name of my dog, and what position I played in lacrosse.</p>
    <p>Here is a link to help you on your search, and a beginning clue, I as well as my parents have Facebook.</p>

    <form>
        <label for="password">Enter the CTF: </label>
        <input type="password" id="password">
        <input type="button" value="Submit" onclick="checkPswd();" />
    </form>

    <script type="text/javascript">
        function checkPswd() {
            var confirmPassword = "1501kiwidefender"; // Correct CTF code
            var password = document.getElementById("password").value; // Correct input ID
            if (password == confirmPassword) {
                window.location = "./welcome.html"; // Redirect to another page on success
            } else {
                alert("CTF is incorrect."); // Alert message if password is incorrect
            }
        }
    </script>
